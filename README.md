# Capstone-Project-Tabletop- 
In this repository are the various pages associated with TableTop. The pages include;
- Login Page: This is will be the first page for our demonstration
- Social Settings Page: This is where the user will select the restaurant type, desired reservation time, and their party size
- Landing page based on user criteria: Here the database will return results
- Table Reservation Page: Where the user will select a desired table
- Confirmation Page: Done once the reservation process is complete
- Restaurant sign-up page: Input form for resaturants to request the addition to TableTop


* Within in the Form page for the table registration page, contains the C# code. This code links to the database. and updates the database, We will possibly add function to another button within this form. The other function of code within that web form is the 5 digit confirmation integer. This is a unique to each confirmation code so that it the table that gets updated with the reservations won't be the same. 

(The C# is within the aspx page within the table registration web form, which is not listed but in the Visual Studio Application)

- This repository also includes all images used associated with the restaurants themselves

The project itself has been done in Visual Studio, originally it was designed in VSCode then migrated once the database needed to be embedded
